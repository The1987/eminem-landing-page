# Project

I built a simple landing page ("look page") for the rapper Eminem.


## Preparation

Before building this project I created this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/IfWhbR4gnhwPI3TdltBxMa/UMG-FED-Project---Eminem?type=design&node-id=0-1&t=cdoLq2LcbaXLhjZw-0) file to analyze comps, make remarks, and plan to build the frontend of this landing page.


## Installation

Clone the repo using the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The1987/eminem-landing-page.git
```
